This project has two parts:
‚Ä¢	Backend (Spring Boot + Gradle): https://github.com/evaperisteri/spot-a-bird-app
‚Ä¢	Frontend (React + Vite): https://github.com/evaperisteri/spot-a-bird-react
Follow the steps below to get everything running locally.
________________________________________
üì¶ Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed on your system:
‚Ä¢	MySQL (v8.x recommended)
‚Ä¢	Java JDK (v17 recommended)
‚Ä¢	Node.js & npm (Node v18+ recommended)
________________________________________
üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup
1.	Open MySQL and run the following commands:
    ```CREATE DATABASE spot_a_bird_db;
     CREATE USER 'spotter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '12345';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON spot_a_bird_db.* TO 'spotter'@'localhost';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;```
2.	Verify that the backend‚Äôs src/main/resources/application.properties file is pointing to the same database name, user, and password.
________________________________________
üîß Backend Setup
1.	Clone the backend repository:
2.	```git clone https://github.com/evaperisteri/spot-a-bird-app```
3.	```cd spot-a-bird-app```
4.	First build (creates the tables):
  -	Open src/main/resources/application.properties
  -	Uncomment the lines under:
    ===== HIBERNATE (Initial, comment out after first build) =====
  -	Comment out the lines under:
 	==== HIBERNATE (Ongoing, tables are already created and filled) ====
  - Then run:
    ```./gradlew clean build```
    ```./gradlew bootRun```
5.	Subsequent builds (when tables already exist):
  -	Reverse the above comments:
  ÔÇß	Comment out the Initial Hibernate lines
  ÔÇß	Uncomment the Ongoing Hibernate lines
  -	Run again:
     ```./gradlew bootRun```
‚úÖ The backend should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

	```cd spot-a-bird-react```
2.	Install dependencies:
      ```npm install```
3.	Run the development server:
      ```npm run dev```
‚úÖ The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.
